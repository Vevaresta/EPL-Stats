A modern Angular 20 web application for tracking football statistics across Europe’s top 5 leagues.  

It allows football fans to explore league tables, top scorers, player stats, and upcoming fixtures in an interactive, responsive interface.

This app provides comprehensive data on teams, players, competitions, and matches, leveraging Football-Data.org API. A lot of data is hidden behind a paywall so I use only what is available for free.
