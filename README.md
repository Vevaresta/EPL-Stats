I'm currently learning Typescript/Angular so I wanted to make a project where I could implement everything I learned so far.

EPL Stats is an Angular 20 web application that lets users explore rich statistics from the English Premier League (EPL).

It pulls live and historical football data from the Football-Data.org API. A lot of data is hidden behind a paywall so I use only what is available for free.

🚀 Features

  - 👤 Player Profiles – See detailed player information such as position, nationality, market value, contract details, and current club.

  - 🎯 Top Scorers & Assists – Track the league’s best performers by goals and assists for the current season.
